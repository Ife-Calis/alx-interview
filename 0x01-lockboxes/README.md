## Must Know

For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

<h2>Concepts Needed:</h2>

1. <h5>Lists and List Manipulation:</h5>

* Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
* [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
2. <h5>Graph Theory Basics:</h5>

* Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
* [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs)
3. <h5>Algorithmic Complexity:</h5>

* Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
* [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)
4. <h5>Recursion:</h5>

* Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
* [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)
5. <h5>Queue and Stack:</h5>

* Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
* [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)
6. <h5>Set Operations:</h5>

* Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
* [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)
By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.
